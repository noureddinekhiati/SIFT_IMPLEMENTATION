# SIFT_IMPLEMENTATION
This is a SIFT  implementation using python and OpenCv
SIFT : The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) is a feature detection algorithm in computer vision to detect and describe local features in images.
The Imlementation process contains  7 steps : <br>
1 - [Buliding a scale space](#1-Buliding-a-scale-space)
2 - (DoG ) which means differential of gauss<br>
3 - Finding keypoints<br>
4-Finding keypoints<br>
5-Getting rid of low contrast keypoints<br>
6-Keypoint orientations<br>
7-Generating a feature<br>
## 1 - Buliding a scale space
